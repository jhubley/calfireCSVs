"*Shaded rows show the fire report is in the EARS system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This large fire list includes fires 300 acres and greater to which CDF responded.  The source of this data is gathered from reports filed by CDF Units statewide.  The information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is verified when a final fire report is submitted by the CDF unit where the fire occurred.  Often this final report does not come in until after a fire season ends when staff have time to finalize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the paperwork.  Other agencies are not obligated to provide reports to CDF on fire activity within their jurisdiction.  Information on this list concerning other agencies should be verified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with those agencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
